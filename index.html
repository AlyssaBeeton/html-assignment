      <article>Hi, my name is Alyssa, I am 19 and from Kingston.
            I did a year of advertising and marketing at St. Lawrence College and switched out because it was not for me and ads are <strong>evil</strong>. 
            I have 2 dogs and 2 cats at home, who I miss and want to steal from my family. 
            I have been living here in Ottawa with my best friend and roommate since September 1<sup>st</sup>. 
            It has taken some getting used to but I like it <em>much</em> more than Kingston.
            I feel pretty neutral about my classes but I know I am going to have a hard time with this class and photography. 
            I have a strong interest in web development, but coding scares me, <em>hopefully</em>, I will get better throughout the semester!</article>
